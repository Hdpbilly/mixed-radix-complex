Moving towards the development of a mixed radix complex which takes a sequence of "symbols" and produces number lines which have a radix defined for each place based on the frequency of occurance of the symbol.

this is for sketching / fun only and has not been optimized. 

eventual goal is to create mixed radix complex for large strings and then compare multiple different strings.
